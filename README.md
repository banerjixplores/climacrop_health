## Dataset Content

- The dataset includes **5,906 observations** of plant‚Äìdisease surveys (1984‚Äì2019) from over 4,300 global studies.
- Paired with ERA5‚Äêland (monthly) and WorldClim 30-year normals.
- Each record includes survey data (host, parasite, location, infected count, etc.) and associated climate metrics (e.g., historical temperature `bio01`, precipitation `bio12`, and recent anomalies).
- Dataset source: [Dryad Repository ‚Äì DOI 10.5061/dryad.p8cz8wb0h](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.p8cz8wb0h)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/banerjixplores/climacrop_health.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd climacrop_health
   ```
3. Create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash      
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Notebook Styling & Automation
    - All Jupyter notebooks use a shared dark-mode theme and a color-blind palette. When you open any notebook, the 00_notebook_style.py script (located in jupyter_notebooks/notebook_style/) automatically injects custom.css so that fonts, colors, gridlines, and code-cell formatting remain consistent across all analyses.
    - As soon as you open any notebook, the styling script will inject custom.css so that fonts, colors, and code‚Äêcell borders remain consistent.
    - Dark-mode CSS: jupyter_notebooks/notebook_style/custom.css: The styling script also ensures that all code cells have a uniform appearance, making it easier to read and understand the analyses.
    - Global plotting style: The Seaborn ‚Äúcolorblind‚Äù palette is set in 00_notebook_style.py, with two predefined colors:
      - WILD_COLOR (greenish-teal) for natural (wild) populations
      - AG_COLOR (navy-blue) for agricultural populations

6. Notebook execution:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE.
   - Run the notebooks in sequence starting from `00_data_load_and_inspect.ipynb` to ensure data is loaded and processed correctly.
     - jupyter_notebooks/00_data_load_and_inspect.ipynb
     - jupyter_notebooks/01_etl_preprocessing.ipynb
     - jupyter_notebooks/02_eda.ipynb
     - ... continue with the remaining notebooks in order.
7. Verify Outputs:
   - Check the `data/processed/` directory for cleaned and preprocessed data files.
   - Review generated visualizations in the EDA notebook.
   - 

## Project Objectives

- **Quantify Climate Drivers:** Measure how contemporaneous weather, deviations from monthly normals (anomalies), and long-term historical climate each influence plant-disease prevalence.  
- **Compare System Sensitivity:** Show that wild plant communities react more sharply to climate swings than managed agricultural systems, due to local adaptation vs. buffering practices like irrigation or pesticides.  
- **Detect Mismatch Effects:** Identify the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù in wild systems where moderate temperature or rainfall anomalies (e.g. +2.7 ¬∞C or ¬±X mm) maximize disease risk, then decline at extreme anomalies.  
- **Predict & Visualize Risk:** Build a concise predictive model and a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard so stakeholders can forecast disease under arbitrary weather scenarios.  
- **Ensure Transparency:** Fully document every cleaning, feature-engineering and modeling step to guarantee reproducibility and clear explanation of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù each region is flagged.

## Analytics & AI for Ecological and Agricultural Challenges

Modern agriculture and conservation face urgent, complex threats from climate change and emerging plant diseases. This project demonstrates how analytics and machine learning can convert vast, fragmented climate‚Äìdisease survey data into actionable insights. By modeling the nonlinear effects of temperature and rainfall anomalies on plant health, and quantifying differences between wild and managed systems, the project enables:

- **Evidence-based policy:** Interactive dashboards help policymakers prioritize regions and pathogen types at greatest risk, supporting better resource allocation and early-warning systems.
- **Farm management:** The risk scoring and zone maps empower farmers and agronomists to make informed decisions about crop selection, planting schedules, and mitigation strategies in a changing climate.
- **Research acceleration:** Open-source code, reproducible analytics, and visualizations accelerate scientific discovery by making new climate‚Äìdisease relationships visible and testable for the first time.

The use of AI (e.g., model selection, feature importance ranking, and interactive dashboards) bridges the gap between raw data and real-world decision-making for both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Business Requirements

- **Risk Forecasting:**  Accept user-supplied temperature & rainfall (including anomalies) to output a disease‚Äêrisk score per region.  
- **Risk Zoning:**  Classify each location into Low/Medium/High risk categories for rapid decision-making.  
- **Global Hotspot Mapping:**  Display an interactive world map pinpointing the highest-risk areas under current or hypothetical scenarios.   
- **Driver Explanation:**  For every forecast, bullet out the top two climate drivers (e.g. ‚Äú+2.7 ¬∞C anomaly,‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äì40 mm rainfall anomaly‚Äù) so stakeholders understand exactly what‚Äôs pushing risk up or down.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?

### **Hypothesis 1: Weather, Anomaly & Historical Climate Effects**  
  Contemporaneous weather (mean temperature or precipitation during a survey), deviations from monthly normals (‚Äúanomalies‚Äù), and long-term historical climate each independently influence plant-disease prevalence.

**Validation Approach:**
- Computed three temperature metrics (`temp_anomaly_C`, `contemp_temp_C`, `annual_mean_temp_C`) and three precipitation metrics (`rain_anomaly_daily`, `monthly_precip_mm_per_day`, `annual_precip_mm_per_day`).
- Fitted separate linear and quadratic models for Wild vs. Agricultural systems.
- Recorded R¬≤, adjusted R¬≤, and p-values for each term.

**Key Temperature Results (Wild vs. Ag):**
| Metric                       | Wild R¬≤ | Ag R¬≤  | Wild p(linear) | Ag p(linear) |
|:----------------------------:|--------:|-------:|:--------------:|:------------:|
| Temperature Anomaly          | 0.0687  | 0.0071 | 4.3e-10        | 1.3e-06      |
| Contemporary Temperature     | 0.0740  | 0.0698 | 1.6e-09        | 4.5e-17      |
| Historical Annual Temperature| 0.1153  | 0.0359 | 9.6e-14        | 7.2e-21      |

**Key Precipitation Results (Wild vs. Ag):**
| Metric                         | Wild R¬≤ | Ag R¬≤  | Wild p(linear) | Ag p(quadratic) |
|:------------------------------:|--------:|-------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| Rainfall Anomaly               | 0.0134  | 0.0590 | 6.6e-03        | 3.8e-06         |
| Contemporary Precipitation     | 0.0365  | 0.0242 | 2.0e-05        | 7.5e-07         |
| Historical Monthly Precipitation| 0.0134  | 0.0590 | 6.7e-03        | 3.7e-06         |
| Annual Precipitation           | 0.0089  | 0.0313 | 2.8e-02        | 3.9e-08         |

**Conclusion:**  
- All three **temperature** metrics explain more variance in wild systems than in agricultural ones.  
- For **precipitation**, only contemporary rainfall is stronger in wild; other metrics are equal or stronger in agriculture.  
- **Hypothesis 1 is validated**: Weather, anomalies, and historical climate significantly influence disease incidence, with wild systems showing greater sensitivity to temperature effects.

---

### **Hypothesis 2: System-Type Sensitivity**
  Wild plant‚Äìpathogen systems exhibit stronger responses to weather, anomalies, and historical climate than do agricultural systems, owing to local adaptation in the wild versus management (irrigation, pesticides, breeding) in crops.

**Validation Approach:**  
- Compared R¬≤ values for each metric (temp & precip) between Wild and Ag.

**Summary (Wild R¬≤ vs. Ag R¬≤):**
| Metric                  | Wild R¬≤ | Ag R¬≤  | Wild > Ag? |
|:-----------------------:|--------:|-------:|:----------:|
| Annual Historical Temp  | 0.1153  | 0.0359 | yes        |
| Temp Anomaly            | 0.0687  | 0.0071 | yes        |
| Contemporary Temp       | 0.0740  | 0.0698 | slightly   |
| Annual Precipitation    | 0.0089  | 0.0313 | no         |
| Precip Anomaly          | 0.0134  | 0.0590 | no         |
| Contemporary Precip     | 0.0365  | 0.0242 | yes        |
| Monthly Historical Precip| 0.0134 | 0.0590 | no         |

**Conclusion:**  
- **Temperature:** Wild > Ag across all metrics.  
- **Precipitation:** Mixed; only contemporary rain shows greater wild sensitivity.

---

### **Hypothesis 3: Thermal & Precipitation Mismatch** 
  In wild systems, disease prevalence peaks when weather deviates from historical norms (e.g., unusually warm in a cool climate or vice versa)‚Äîa ‚Äúmismatch‚Äù effect. In contrast, agricultural systems show little or no such mismatch, because management buffers extremes.

**Validation Approach:**  
- Fitted OLS with interaction `anomaly √ó historical` for Wild vs. Ag.

1. Data & Anomalies

- Computed temperature and rainfall anomalies as deviations from long-term monthly means.

- Took absolute values to capture ‚Äúmismatch magnitude.‚Äù

2. Statistical Approach
- Separate OLS regressions for Wild vs. Ag:

Temperature
```python
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# e.g. for wild_df or ag_df
model = smf.ols(
    formula='incidence ~ temp_anomaly_C * monthly_temp_C',
    data=system_df
).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

Rainfall
```python
model = smf.ols(
    formula='incidence ~ rain_anomaly_daily * monthly_precip_mm_per_day',
    data=system_df
).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

- Extracted the interaction coefficient (anomaly:historical) to quantify mismatch sensitivity.

3. Key Interaction Coefficients
   
|         Effect        | Wild Coef. | Ag Coef. |   p-value   |
| :-------------------: | ---------: | -------: | :---------: |
| **Temp √ó Historical** |    ‚Äì0.0142 |  ‚Äì0.0031 | **< 0.001** |
| **Rain √ó Historical** |    ‚Äì0.0312 |  ‚Äì0.0069 |   *< 0.01*  |

**Conclusion:**  
- Wild systems show strong negative interactions‚Äîclassic mismatch.  
- Agricultural systems have much weaker mismatch effects.
- **Hypothesis 3 is validated**: Wild plant‚Äìpathogen systems exhibit stronger mismatch effects, where deviations from historical norms lead to increased disease incidence.

---

### **Hypothesis 4: Geographic & Pathogen-Type Modulation of Climate‚ÄìDisease Links** 
Geographic variation in the identity and thermal/moisture tolerances of pathogens (fungi vs. bacteria vs. viruses vs. nematodes, etc.) causes differences in how temperature or precipitation anomalies translate into disease incidence. Regions dominated by narrow-tolerance pathogens will show sharper peaks or troughs, whereas regions with broad-tolerance pathogens will exhibit smoother responses.

*In layman terms* This means that different pathogen groups (virus, bacteria, pests, eukaryotic parasites) and their climatic‚Äêtolerance breadths produce distinct anomaly‚Äìincidence curves.

**Validation Approach:**
- Computed `abs_temp_anom` and `abs_precip_anom` for each site.
- Mapped `Antagonist_type_general` ‚Üí pathogen group.
- Defined `tolerance_class` (narrow/intermediate/broad) by 5‚Äì95% anomaly range.
- Fitted OLS models with `anomaly √ó pathogen_group` and `anomaly √ó tolerance_class` interaction terms.

**Key Results (Temp √ó Pathogen Group):**
| Group             | Interaction Coef. | p-value |
|:-----------------:|-----------------:|--------:|
| Eukaryotic parasite | ‚Äì0.0124         | 0.545   |
| Pest               | ‚Äì0.0076         | 0.812   |
| Virus              | ‚Äì0.0335         | 0.099   |

None of these terms were significant (all p > 0.05).

**Tolerance-Class Effect (Temp √ó Class):**
| Class         | Interaction Coef. | p-value |
|:-------------:|-----------------:|--------:|
| Intermediate  | ‚Äì0.0196         | 0.003 **|
| Narrow        | +0.0048         | 0.848   |

Only intermediate‚Äêtolerance pathogens show a significantly flatter response; narrow‚Äêtolerance behave like broad.

**Conclusion:**  
‚óè Pathogen identity alone does **not** modulate mismatch sensitivity.  
‚óè Climatic‚Äêtolerance breadth has a **weak** effect (only intermediate class differs).  

---

### **Hypothesis 5: Transmission-Mode Sensitivity to Anomalies** 
Soil- or contact-transmitted pathogens respond more strongly to precipitation anomalies than vector-borne pathogens, because direct pathogens rely immediately on environmental moisture for dispersal and infection, whereas vectors buffer short-term extremes.

*In layman terms:* Diseases spread directly (e.g. through soil or touch) will spike more sharply under drought or heavy rain than those carried by insects or mites.

**Validation Approach:**
- Cleaned `Transmission_mode` into two groups: **Direct** vs. **Vector-borne**.  
- Computed `abs_precip_anom = |rain_anomaly_daily|`.  
- Fitted an OLS model with `incidence ~ abs_precip_anom * C(transmission_mode_group, Treatment("Direct"))`.  
- Extracted main effects and the interaction term to compare slopes.

**Key Results (Precipitation √ó Transmission Mode):**
| Term                                                                     | Coefficient | p-value |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|--------:|
| **Intercept (Direct slope)**                                             |      0.1171 |  <0.001 |
| **Vector-borne main effect** (offset at zero anomaly)                    |     ‚Äì0.0414 |   0.040 |
| **Direct slope** (`abs_precip_anom`)                                     |      0.0505 |  <0.001 |
| **Vector-borne vs Direct slope diff** (`abs_precip_anom √ó Vector-borne`) |     ‚Äì0.0150 |   0.062 |

**Conclusion:**  
- **Direct pathogens** have a steeper incidence increase with precipitation anomalies (slope ‚âà 0.0505) than **vector-borne** pathogens (slope ‚âà 0.0355).  
- The slope difference is marginally non-significant (p ‚âà 0.062), but the trend **reverses** our original expectation.  
- **Revised insight:** Directly transmitted pathogens are more sensitive to moisture anomalies‚Äîlikely because they cannot escape extreme wet/dry conditions via a host vector.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used

- **Data Cleaning**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **EDA**: `seaborn`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`
- **Modeling**: `sklearn` (RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor)
- **Explainability**: SHAP (planned)

**Limitations**:
- Spatial resolution is ~10km, which may obscure local variability.
- Missing metadata for some studies.

**Generative AI Tools**:
- Copilot and ChatGPT used for idea brainstorming, model structuring, and narrative alignment.

## Ethical & Scientific considerations
- **Data Privacy and Source Ethics:**
The project exclusively utilizes aggregated, anonymized data from publicly available, peer-reviewed sources (Kirk et al., Ecology Letters 2024; Dryad repository), ensuring no personally identifiable or sensitive information is used. Data use complies with FAIR and open-science guidelines.

- **Bias and Fairness:**
- Potential geographical and system-type biases (e.g., over-representation of agricultural sites in certain regions) are acknowledged. Analytical methods and visualizations explicitly compare wild and managed systems to highlight such gaps, and limitations are transparently communicated in both the README and dashboard.
- When limitations due to data gaps or bias could not be resolved analytically, they are clearly stated in the dashboard, final report, and README to inform users of caveats in interpretation.

- **Transparency and Reproducibility:**
- All data processing, modeling, and visualization steps are open source and fully documented, allowing for independent verification and continuous improvement by the research community.
- Comprehensive notes and rationale for analytical decisions are provided in all Jupyter notebooks and markdown documentation files.

- **Societal and Legal Implications:**
Insights from this project can inform policy and management, but are not intended for direct clinical or regulatory use without further validation. The project promotes responsible use of data-driven insights and encourages collaborative review by stakeholders.

Dashboard Pages and Content:

| Page                   | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Project Summary        | Landing page with logo, objectives, dataset summary, business requirements, hero image     |
| Geographical Analysis  | Interactive global map, spatial risk visualization, sampling bias insight, data download   |
| Hypotheses Validation  | Collapsible hypotheses, validation steps, rationale for each, and clear result callouts    |
| Correlations           | Heatmaps, scatterplots, and callout boxes for redundancy and feature selection             |
| Mismatch               | Visualizes mismatch effects by climate anomaly, system type, and pathogen group            |
| Climate by Pathogen    | Violin plots, stakeholder interpretation, and actionable insights                          |
| Pathogen Distributions | Stacked barplots for host, pathogen, and climate, with interpretation and recommendations  |
| Model Insights         | Model comparison tables (R¬≤, metrics), permutation importance, dropdown filters, scenarios |

Styling notes:

- Custom color and shape styling for all sidebar navigation and information blocks.

- Consistent use of markdown for objective summaries, requirements, and data source details.

- Contextual visualizations and insight boxes designed for both technical and non-technical users.

## Unfixed Bugs
* HTML/Plotly Export: Some Plotly/HTML visualizations may not scale uniformly or require scrolling on some browsers.
* Streamlit Image Scaling: Not all images are pixel-perfect; column centering is used as a workaround.
* Slug Size Limit (Deployment): Heroku require assets to be minimized or externalized.
* Missing Metadata: Certain surveys lack pathogen or host details, limiting some stratified analyses.
* Spatial Resolution: ERA5/WorldClim data at ~10km; sub-field/local heterogeneity not captured.
* Explainability: SHAP integration pending; package conflicts under Streamlit Cloud.

## Development Roadmap

| Phase               | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Understanding  | Clean, merge, validate, and profile survey and climate data          |
| Feature Engineering | Create climate anomalies, zone metadata, and engineered features     |
| Modeling            | Train/test ML models (RF, Ridge, SVR, XGB, stacking); cross-validate |
| Dashboard           | Build Streamlit app with interactive, filterable visualizations      |
| Explainability      | Implement permutation importance, plan SHAP integration              |
| Deployment & Docs   | Deploy to Streamlit Cloud, finalize README, collect peer feedback    |
| Review & Iterate    | Address feedback, refine models, enhance dashboard usability         |

Key Challenges:
- Hyperparameter tuning during machine learning.

Next Steps:

- SHAP-based model explainability

- Automated retraining pipelines

- More granular mapping (sub-national)

- Stakeholder survey integration


## Deployment
Streamlit Cloud (production):
[Streamlit](https://climacrophealth-wjb9htkjbammfgqzsedk6f.streamlit.app/)
[Heroku](https://climacrophealth-9f3f3967d5ca.herokuapp.com/)

Heroku (legacy):
Previous test deployments. Use .slugignore to control asset inclusion.

Setup:

Store large assets (plots, images) in /images/

Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

Standard Streamlit/Heroku deploy as per docs

### Heroku

* The App live link is: [Streamlit](https://climacrophealth-wjb9htkjbammfgqzsedk6f.streamlit.app/)
                        [Heroku](https://climacrophealth-9f3f3967d5ca.herokuapp.com/)
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. From the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.
